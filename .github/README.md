# @zdrazil dotfiles

These are dotfiles that I use every day. They're managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/), a dotfile manager.

## Install

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install yadm
yadm clone https://github.com/zdrazil/system-bootstrap.git
```
