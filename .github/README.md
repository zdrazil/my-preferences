# @zdrazil dotfiles

These are dotfiles that I use every day. They're managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/), a dotfile manager.

## Install

These commands will install dotfiles to your home directory and they will also run a [boostrap script](../.config/yadm/bootstrap).

For dotfiles, if a file already exists locally and has content that differs from the one in this repository, the local file will be left unmodified, and youâ€™ll have to review and resolve the differences.

This does not apply for the bootstrap script. Please read through it to understand what it does.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install yadm
yadm clone https://github.com/zdrazil/system-bootstrap.git
```

## Setup git

Use instructions from [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to setup SSH keys or use the quick setup in next section.

### Quick setup

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Mac
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Linux
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Windows

```
